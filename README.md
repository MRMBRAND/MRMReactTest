# MRM React Test Project

MRM deals with many companies and handles a lot of product data.

Your job will be to build a very simple website using ReactJS that displays some product data.

In this repository you will find a JSON file: `products.json` with some product data. Each product will have the following fields:

```js
{
  "name": "XXXXX",
  "description": "XXXX",
  "category": "XXXX"
}
```

Use `create-react-app` (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a simple skeleton for your project - this gives you a locally up-and-running React app within seconds.

Create a website that uses the product data so users can:
1. See a list of all products,
2. Toggle between categories and see a list of products per category
3. Delete a product
4. Add a new product

**NOTE:** For steps 3 & 4 you don't actually have to modify the `products.json` file, it's enough to just use the data there as a starting point (e.g. you could use the data as the initial state in your main component and then just add/delete from the state)

Extra cool points:

* Good looking and intuitive UI
* Unit tests

This project is intended to be a creative exercise so the structure of the application and the UI/UX is left as a design decision for you. **Timebox yourself to just a few hours at most** - it's alright if you don't finish everything 100%! The main purpose of the project is to talk about it afterwards.

Have fun!
